#### By _**Rachael Bouissey**_

## Description

** 
- Factsolotl is a water quality fact finder for public schools in California. 

- A query will return lead contamination information about all sampling events matching search criteria. 

- A visual representation of the number of schools with lead contamination greater than the EPA's action level, per county, is shown on a google geo chart of California. 

- This app was made with JavaScript and React, and will be built for mobile with React Native. **


## Known Issues

* Routing isn't implemented as of 12/18/19. Views are rendered with state. Will update as the app is refactored.
